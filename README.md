# MediaServer
This wants to be a project to access my video files and serve it via LAN

The structure is the following

```
├Videos
├----Course.01
|    └----Lecture.1
|    |      └----Lecture.01.mp4
|    |      └----Lecture.02.mp4
|    └----Lecture.2
|           └----Lecture.01.mp4
└----Course.02
     └----Lecture.1
     |      └----Lecture.02.mp4
     |      └----Lecture.03.mp4
     └----Lecture.2
            └----Lecture.02.mp4
            └----Lecture.03.mp4

```


## Known Issue (currently fixing)
1. The name of the file and the folders can't contain spaces or symbols now, maybe in the future version 
2. Totally not responsive
3. Weird behaviour when changing time somethimes (need to investigate this)
4. Set speed not working
5. Don't keep track of viewed files and completed Topics
6. I have to finish the init script to initialize the Database 
7. Make an "installation" page for the first time one use it
8. Add tooltip for Go and Speed
